// User h = Coach(007, "ian");
// User i = Officer(008 "grant");
// User j = Officer(009, "ian");


//  -   lowkey not everything needs to work but i feel like we should get the basic
//      user makes/cancels a reservation and can view the schedule done asap!!  

// TODO - IF SOMEONE COULD ASK THE TAS ABT ANY OF THESE THATD BE GREAT AKDLD

//  - implement some sort of login in here (where user inputs any num 001 through 009)
//       then, we can call somthing like a->User::viewMenu() and it should show their
//       appropriate menu (ANUSHKA WILL DO THIS :) )

//  -  figure out the modifying logic for users to officers? how can we refer to 
//       created officer objects, since they are the ones to make a time change?
//       should a user have a list of officers that they can refer too?

//  -   possibly change all raw pointers to smart pointers. idrk how smart pointers
//       work exactly but im scared abt memory leaks? 

//  -   implement all the checks for valid reservations and stuff   


// LOGIC QUESTIONS

//  -    the sending requests to officers/logic
//  -    is using chrono::time::time_pt (EXAMPLE GIVEN IN RESRERVATION.HPP &
//       MEMBER.CPP) the best way to represent date and time?
